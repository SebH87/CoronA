# ProLab (Protein Labels)

ProLab is a tool for creating amino acid labels for mutations, which can be used for labelling plots in a DeViVa analysis. The tool takes the "datasub.txt" file, which is created by the DeViVa filtering tool.

__USAGE:__

ProLab is a Python script that can be run on any operating system. Please ensure that you are using Python 3.x! To execute ProLab, go to a terminal and type in:

_python ProLab.py_

or execute the file directly. Ensure that the "datasub.txt" file is saved in the same directory as the ProLab.py script!

__DEPENDENCIES:__

ProLab only needs one additional Python package, which needs to be installed by the user:

* pandas

If you have already installed all dependencies for DeViVa, no additional packages need to be installed here!
